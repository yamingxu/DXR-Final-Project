# TickTock
This is the final project for CS63 ARVR development. <br>
I collaborated with other two designer and one developer. I was responsible for the second scene(past scene) development and scene switch functions except the photo frame and oven.<br>
If you want to check the whole project then you need to download the whole DXR-Final-Project folder. <br>
Scripts are inside the scripts folder. <br>
The final apk is "FinalBuildForTechnigala.apk". Link to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0clXgJEV22vgzOpcGApzPQ-P--7ZSTQ/view?usp=sharing <br>
The final scene on a platform with a cube is to reset the game to scene1 for presentation purpose. It's not part of the game experience.
